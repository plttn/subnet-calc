# Subnet Calc

Subnet calculator for previous school assignment.

## Description

Using vectors and `uint8_t` allows for bitwise math rather than treating them like strings.

## Caveats

Please don't use this for a homework assignment. You don't learn anything by stealing
this from me, and as someone who graded the assignments the year after I wrote this,
if you're the kind of person stealing it, it'll be fairly obvious that you
didn't come up with these methods yourself.
